# Cellworld VR

pre-major (door) version - revamping client/server system and creating dedicated plugin

I still need to fill this out. ****

## Introduction 
Current version works well for `single-player` in VR at 60Hz. 

### System 

- Meta Quest 3 
- Unreal Engine 5.3

## Notes: 

- Habitat (mouse) to human scale -> 2.63 (length_pred (1.75 m for humans) * 1.4 (prey to predator scale) * 21 (#cells) = 2.63) 

### Accuracy and Performance metrics

#### Occlusion Placement 

```
Occlusion offset.......1.302 % 
VR-Hab diameter (m)....33
VR-Hab scale...........14.03
```
