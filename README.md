# Cellworld VR

pre-major (door) version - revamping client/server system and creating dedicated plugin

I still need to fill this out. ****

## Introduction 
Current version works well for `single-player` in VR at 90Hz. 


### System 

- Meta Quest 3 
- Unreal Engine 5.3

## Notes: 

- Habitat (mouse) to human scale -> 2.63 (length_pred (1.75 m for humans) * 1.4 (prey to predator scale) * 21 (#cells) = 2.63)
